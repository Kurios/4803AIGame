     *
     * What is the meaning of a word, and well...
     *
     * it has an emoitonal context and meaning... and the combination of words change the meaning of words...
     * but yah... welcome to a fun problem of trying to make something that is implicit to humans understandable to computers
     *
     * But the word itself is meaningless.
