Will have most recent stuff, plus I am planning on cleaning up the source here, so it will get more readable.

As far as finding the AI Elements... Parts of it are buried in... 

Also, it will get prettier... I promise. And no matter what, the bunch of files I put in t-square so you have
them may not be the ones you want to look at... just saying.

Caverns/Caverns/Char/Ghost.cs
  * The ghost files. Its AI stuff is all confundled in that class...
Caverns/Caverns/Char/Girl.cs
  * And the girl files. See above. But its an even worse mess. Maybe.

KLib/NeuralNet/emotionState
   * Contains the files used in the backend emotion engine...
   * the eSpace, the lowspace, the highspace the the wrapper for both of them.

VettingConsole/Agent.cs
   * Doesnt actually run... but it is the best documented part of the system. Mostly I ranted in documentation there, then
   * I coded back where it mattered.
